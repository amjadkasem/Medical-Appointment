 Medical Appointment No-Show Analysis

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on a medical appointment dataset. The objective is to identify the factors that influence whether a patient shows up for their appointment or not.

---

🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

---
 📊 Key Steps in the Analysis
1. Data Cleaning 
   - Removed duplicates and irrelevant features  
   - Treated missing values and outliers  

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* 
   - Visualized distributions and relationships between variables  
   - Focused on age, gender, disability, and whether the patient received an SMS reminder

---

🔍 Findings
- Age and receiving SMS reminders appear to correlate with show/no-show behavior.
- Certain health conditions (like disabilities) may slightly affect attendance.

 📌 Future Plans
- Try classification models (Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM)  
- Extend analysis using Power BI  
- Improve visual storytelling
